      <p>Valo had originally envisioned the album's front cover as featuring a replica of his body that would slowly turn into a skeleton as it went down.Due to minimal funds and time constraints, the band were unable to fulfill this idea, instead opting for a more traditional photo session with Vertti Teräsvuori. The finished cover art was meant as a combination of goth and eroticism with its dark red color scheme, while Valo posing was described as a "Jeanne d’Arc -style tortured figure". BMG were not fond of the finished artwork, feeling that it evoked too much of a "Billy Idol vibe" by just having one band member on the cover.The label also protested to the band's idea of having the name HIM barely visible on the cover. "For You" was also chosen as the first track on the album at the insistence of BMG, with "Intro" in parentheses. According to Valo, this was done because the label didn't want people just listening to the long opening of the song, thinking the whole album would be like that. "Your Sweet Six Six Six" was later switched out as the opening track on the international edition of the album.

      <h2>Razorblade Romance</h2>

          <a href="#" class="gram"><img alt="Razorblade Romance" src="album2.png"></a>
      </div>
      <p>The overall sound of Razorblade Romance features less focus on guitar than the band's debut, in favor a sleeker and more melodic sound, influenced by the music of the 1980s. "I Love You (Prelude to Tragedy)" was first considered for Greatest Lovesongs Vol. 666, and was thus demoed several times. Valo described the song as an "apt intro for the record. Short, tight, and smacks you right in the face". "Poison Girl" was written about a specific girl in Valo's life and about "how you can destroy something so beautiful". "Join Me in Death" was the first single chosen from the album, and was written around the time of Greatest Lovesongs Vol. 666's release. Valo continued to work on the song for approximately two years, and took influence from '80s music and the album Isola by Kent. Lyrically, the song was inspired by Romeo and Juliet, as well as Blue Öyster Cult's "(Don't Fear) The Reaper", and talks about "how far are you willing to go for somebody you care for". According to Valo, "Join Me in Death" was also the first song to feature "that corniness and toungue-in-cheek nature, that was missing from the first album". The UK division of BMG initially refused to release the album, as they felt that "Join Me in Death" was too much of a "schlager", fearing it would ruin the rest of the album.

          <a href="#" class="gram"><img alt="Deep Shadows and Brilliant Highlights" src="album3.png"></a>
      </div>
      <p>HIM began demoing songs for their third album in the northern fall of 2000 at Petrax Studios in Hollola, with producer T.T. Oksala.Due to pressure coming in from BMG's international branches to repeat the success of Razorblade Romance, producer Kevin Shirley was brought on board to help helm the band's upcoming album, having previously worked with Bon Jovi, Aerosmith and The Black Crowes among others. While Shirley was excited to be working with HIM, the band were not entirely on board with his style of producing, as well as the amount of money the label was spending on hiring him.Despite this, Valo later admitted that some of Shirley's ideas did improve the material, including "Heartache Every Moment" and "Salt In Our Wounds". The band were faced with multiple difficulties during the making-of the album, with Valo stating that "the industry wasn't expecting [Razorblade Romance] to be such a hit that it was, so it meant that now there was like seventeen thousand different A&R people from the record companies and whatnots in the studio, and everybody had an opinion." The recording process for the album took approximately eleven months, which Valo felt was too long and affected the material too severely. He explained, stating: "When we started recording the third album, we were into stoner rock and Black Sabbath.. At the end we were into Neil Young and it shows on the record."</p>

      <h2>Love Metal</h2>

          <a href="#" class="gram"><img alt="Love Metal" src="album4.png"></a>
      </div>
      <p>Love Metal is the fourth studio album by Finnish gothic rock band HIM. Released on 11 April 2003, HIM began recording demos for the album in northern spring 2002.After nearly breaking up following an exhausting supporting tour for their previous album Deep Shadows and Brilliant Highlights, HIM took a two month break in early 2002.While other members of the band flew on vacation, vocalist Ville Valo stayed behind in Helsinki and began writing new material.When HIM regrouped at the turn of February and March 2002, the band felt re-energized, as well as excited about the new songs Valo had written. The group soon began recording demos in the spring of 2002, with producer Hiili Hiilesmaa, who had previously produced the band's 1997 debut album. HIM continued to work on new material for approximately six months, before entering Finnvox Studios in September 2002 to record their fourth studio album with Hiilesmaa acting as producer.The recording process lasted two months, after which the band flew to Los Angeles for two weeks to mix the album at Studio Scream with Tim Palmer, who had previously worked with Pearl Jam and U2 among others. Additional mixing for the tracks "Buried Alive by Love" and "Sweet Pandemonium" was done at Sphere Studios in London, while the album was mastered at Sterling Sound in New York by George Marino.</p>

      <h2>Dark Light</h2>

          <a href="#" class="gram"><img alt="Dark Light" src="album5.png"></a>
      </div>
      <p>Dark Light is the fifth studio album by Finnish gothic rock band HIM. Released on 26 September 2005.According to Valo, the band entered the studio with the idea of creating a cross between Black Sabbath's Sabbath Bloody Sabbath and Achtung Baby by U2, and Dark Light has been described as more "polished" and "accessible" than HIM's previous albums.The first half of the record was written long before entering the studio, while the second half was composed a month and a half prior, after Valo threw away much of the original material, because "it was too slow". According to Valo, the band's approach on Dark Light was to make the songs sound more "cinematic, epic, and close to the listeners", inspired by the works of composer Angelo Badalamenti. Valo also mentioned This Mortal Coil as an influence on the album's "spooky, eerie" sound.Lyrically, Dark Light deals mostly with themes of "girls and boys and the politics of the heart".</p>

      <h2>Venus Doom</h2>
    <div class"heartgrampic">
          <a href="#" class="gram"><img alt="Venus Doom" src="album6.png"></a>
      </div>
      <p>Venus Doom is the sixth studio album by Finnish gothic rock band HIM. The album was recorded at Finnvox Studios in Helsinki, Finland, with producers Hiili Hiilesmaa and Tim Palmer, both whom had collaborated with the band on various occasions, and released on 14 September 2007. The making-of the album was plagued with problems Valo was facing in his personal life. Exhaustion and his break-up with fiancée Jonna Nygrén had severely affected Valo's worsening alcohol abuse, resulting in him reportedly vomiting and defecating blood at one point. All these issues came to a head when Valo suffered a nervous breakdown during the recording process.Valo did manage to recuperate, until the mixing stage, when he began drinking again. Eventually he was admitted to the Promises Rehabilitation Clinic in Malibu by the band's manager Seppo Vesterinen.</p>

      <h2>Screamworks: Love in Theory and Practice</h2>
    <div class"heartgrampic">
          <a href="#" class="gram"><img alt="Screamworks: Love in Theory and Practice" src="album7.png"></a>
      </div>
      <p>Screamworks: Love in Theory and Practice, Chapters 1–13 is the seventh studio album by Finnish gothic rock band HIM. Released on 8 February 2010, the album was recorded at The Lair Studios and NRG Studios in Los Angeles, California, with producer Matt Squire. Following his time in rehab, Screamworks was the first HIM album vocalist Ville Valo worked on completely sober. Musically Valo has described Screamworks as a "lighter shade of black", being more "direct" and "straightforward" than some of HIM's previous albums. The album was heavily influenced by music of the 1980s, including such acts as a-ha, Depeche Mode and The Cult, and also featured a bigger focus on keyboards to counterbalance the guitar-centric sound of the band's previous album Venus Doom. Screamworks has thus been described as one of the band's most accessible albums to date, sounding more "hopeful" and "poppy".Thematically the album was largely inspired by a relationship of Valo's with an undisclosed partner, who served as his muse while writing the material.</p>

      <h2>Tears on Tape</h2>
    <div class"heartgrampic">
          <a href="#" class="gram"><img alt="Tears on Tape" src="album8.png"></a>
      </div>
      <p>Tears on Tape is the eighth and final studio album by Finnish band HIM, released April 26, 2013 in Finland, April 29, 2013 in Europe, and on April 30, 2013 in the US and Canada. Because the band had lacked a label the new album was paid for out of pocket, putting them in a unique position of owning all publishing rights to their music which allowed them to shop the album to various labels for distribution. In February 2013 it was announced that the new album would be licensed to three separate record companies, one for each market. Agreements were reached with Universal Records in Europe, Razor & Tie in the United States, and Cooking Vinyl's new rock imprint DoubleCross in the United Kingdom and Ireland. With this new strategy came the decision to release separate singles simultaneously to each market. The track "Into the Night" was chosen for the Finnish market, "All Lips Go Blue" for the UK and US, and "Tears on Tape" for the rest of Europe. Music videos were filmed for each single in late February to early March 2013.</p>
