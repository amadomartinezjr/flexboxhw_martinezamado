      <h1>H.I.M. Discography</h1>
      <h2>The real name for H.I.M </h2>
      <p> His Infernal Majesty </p>
      <h2>What does a heartagram mean</h2>
      <p>The heartagram is a combination of a heart and a pentagram. That's why it's called a heartagram. If you're looking for a 'deeper' meaning, the heartagram symbolises love and hate, life and death; the struggles that accompany love.</p>
      <h2> Why they split up</h2>
      <p>According to Valo's statement on the website, the "official" reason for the break up is the following: After quarter of a century of Love and Metal intertwined we sincerely feel HIM has run its unnatural course and adieus must be said in order to make way for sights, scents and sounds yet unexplored.</p>
      <h2>What is Valo up to now</h2>
      <p>HIM's Ville Valo Announces Return to Music. It's been nearly a year since HIM performed their final show in Helsinki, but vocalist Ville Valo isn't finished with music just yet. A new project, Ville Valo & Agents, has just been announced with the first track from the project receiving a Sept. 21 release date.</p>
      <h2>Will Ville ever return</h2>
      <p>On March 21, Ville shocked his fans by releasing 3 singles with redesigning the bands logo.</p>
